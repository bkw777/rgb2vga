This is a preserved copy of the original jic compiled by Luis Antoniosi.
In theory it should not be needed because the source does compile and and the resulting jic does work,
but Roger Taylor says that at least for him at least sometimes, the original jic seems to produce a bit more stable picture than one compiled new from this source.
So, you may want to try this copy vs a self-compiled one.
