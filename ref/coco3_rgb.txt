[1] Both pins tied to the same ground, not separate chassis/shield ground and signal ground)

[2] No connection and no physical pin present. The pin header has no other form of polarity key (no shroud with polarity notch), so to make a polarity keyed cable install a plug in pin 6 in the female connector on the cable.

[3] RGB Monitor Sensing INPUT  
 I/O control register 0xFF22 Bit 3, Peripheral Interface B, bit 3, pin 13 on U4/IC4 PIA1 6821.  
 Has 4.7k pullup to 5v and 4.7k current limit between RGB port and U4, so to use this pin, just tie pin 10 directly to GND in the monitor or peripheral
